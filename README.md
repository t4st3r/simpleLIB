# simpleLIB
A simple library for Arduino IDE, a collection of somewhat random functionalities that I have created for various projects.

This library is only tested and verified on stm32 architecture, but there are no architecture-specific functions used. Therefore, the library is only stated as compatible with stm32, but it should theoretically work on different architectures as well.

IF ANYONE TESTS AND VERIFIES THE FUNCTIONALITY ON DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES, PLEASE CREATE A PULL REQUEST TO ADD THE ARCHITECTURE AS COMPATIBLE.
THANKS!

README AND DOCS WILL BE FLESHED OUT WHEN THE LIBRARY IS MORE COMPLETE
